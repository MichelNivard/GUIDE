 Here we are maintaining the code for GUIDE, including implementations of the main algorithm and scripts used for generating plots. See https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.03.592285v1 for more information. 


**!! This is Michel's Private fork, I am translatigng GUIDE to R, and experimenting with SEM like adaptations and changes, not for productino is likely to be broken all the time.**
